# lab0:
In this lab, designed and implemented a distributed message passing framework. To use .yaml file to configure distributed nodes, allowing them to send and receive messages, and add message tranfer rules like "duplicate", "drop", "delay" to simulate network conditions.

# lab1:
In this lab, based on lab0, designed and implemented a system to synchronize events happening at distributed nodes, using Logical and Vector clocks. Also a logger process is added to support message logging and re-ordering according to Logical/Vector clocks.

# lab2:
In this lab, based on lab1, designed and implemented the system to support reliable and causally-ordered message multicasting among distributed nodes.

# lab3:
In this lab, based on lab2, designed and implemented distributed mutual exclusion, to support distributed nodes to come to consensus about resource allocation.
